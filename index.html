	  <p><span>SUMMARY</span><br>
	  My goal is to gain new knowledge and skills in web development. 
	  I would like to get to the second stage of this course first of all because I 
	  consider such training the most acceptable and interesting, and it's not even 
	  that the course is free. Thanks to the organization of these courses, it is 
	  interesting to participate in it, teachers, as I understand it - are current 
	  developers who will be able to give useful and relevant advice, instead of 
	  boring template phrases and parting words from teachers who work only because 
	  of the need for money. It is interesting to try to prove yourself, to feel some 
	  competition for the opportunity of further training. I hope that I will be able 
	  to continue my education here and improve my English skills in the process, so 
	  that I don't have to use a translator again :)</p>

	  <p><span>ENGLISH SKILLS</span><br>
	  The test showed that B1. Understanding is better than the wording of my 
	  speech, we still need to work on it more, I think, there is simply not 
	  enough practice for training.</p>
