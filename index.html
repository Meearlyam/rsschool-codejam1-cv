	<p>SUMMARY<br>
	My goal is to gain new knowledge and skills in web development. 
	I would like to get to the second stage of this course first of all because I 
	consider such training the most acceptable and interesting, and it's not even 
	that the course is free. Thanks to the organization of these courses, it is 
	interesting to participate in it, teachers, as I understand it - are current 
	developers who will be able to give useful and relevant advice, instead of 
	boring template phrases and parting words from teachers who work only because 
	of the need for money. It is interesting to try to prove yourself, to feel some 
	competition for the opportunity of further training. I hope that I will be able 
	to continue my education here and improve my English skills in the process, so 
	that I don't have to use a translator again :)</p>
	
	<p>SKIILS<br>
	I have skills in working with C# and C++ programming languages, now at the 
	University we start working with Java. I am also familiar with the basics 
	of algorithms and data structures, now we are also taking such a course at 
	the University. Some skills in working with html and css, and the desire to improve them.</p>
	
	<p>EDUCATION<br>
	Sophomore at BSU FAMI, Applied Informatics: Software Developing</p>
	
	<p>ENGLISH SKILLS<br>
	The test showed that B1. Understanding is better than the wording of my 
	speech, we still need to work on it more, I think, there is simply not 
	enough practice for training.</p>
